How to create a new issue for the Issues log:

Title: 
Enter a title in the field above. 
Pick a short, precise title for your issue. It should be easily searchable and not too vague. 
EXAMPLE: "Can't enter new subspecies into DigiApp"
NOT GOOD: "DigiApp Bug"

Description: 
Write a detailed description of your issue, including screenshots etc.
Remember to also include things like the DigiApp version number or other relevant technical information.

When you're done, you can delete this template text from the issue and click "create" to save the issue to the Issues log :)
