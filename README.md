# DaSSCo-Digitization
This Repo is for anything related to DaSSCo Digitization that can not be assigned to one specific pipeline Repo.

There are already Repos concerning the pinned insects, the Herbarium sheets or the Mass digitization App, 
but we encounter more and more projects and issues that are more general and can not be assigned to one of those more specific repositories. 
To avoid having copies of these issues on each Repo, we agreed to create this more general Repo for anything that doesn't fit into a more specific category.

The main project hosted here will be the Digitization Issues Log, which allows Digitizers to record any issues they come across during Digitization. 
This was orignially an Excel sheet on the OneDrive, but it was decided to move it to GitHub.
