# DaSSCo-Digitization
This Repo is for anything related to DaSSCo Digitization that can not be assigned to one specific pipeline Repo.

There are already Repos concerning the pinned insects, the Herbarium sheets or the Mass digitization App, 
but we encounter more and more projects and issues that are more general and can not be assigned to one of those more specific repositories. 
To avoid having copies of these issues on each Repo, we agreed to create this more general Repo for anything that doesn't fit into a more specific category.

## Issues Log Project Board
The current version of the Digitization Issues Log is now hosted here, which allows Digitizers to record any issues they come across during Digitization. 
The log is presented as a GitHub project board associated with this repo.
This was orignially an Excel sheet on the OneDrive, but it was decided to move it to GitHub.
The old Issues Log has been archived to the N-Drive: "N:\SCI-SNM-DigitalCollections\DaSSCo\Active shared documents\Archive versions\Old Issues Log_20250618.xlsx" and can also be found under "Archive version" on the OneDrive.

## Digitizer Operations Project Board
